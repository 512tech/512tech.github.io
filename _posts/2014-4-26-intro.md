As an introduction, Gilad and I are both students in computer science at Columbia University, and close friends. When we are not building technology, we are talking about it. So we guessed we would share our thoughts and experiences with the world.

We realized that people are busy and attention spans continue to shrink. To keep things interesting and to-the-point, we are limiting each post to 512 words. This constraint will also help us become better writers.

We hope you finds the posts to follow exciting. We for sure look forward to it.
