title: RapGenius and the Talmud
---

I've been thinking a lot about RapGenius and annotation. But it is not until recently that I realized that the most interesting example of annotation has been lying there, in front of me, my entire life.

The Talmud, or body of Jewish law, contains one of the most fascinating examples of annotation, annotation on annotation, and annotation on annotation on annotation.

The chain of annotations in the Talmud traverses languages and eras. For those interested in annotation and commentary, the Talmud is an incredible source of awe and inspiration.

The Talmud is the body of Jewish civil law. It is comprised of the Mishnah and the Guemarah. The Mishnah represents the oral tradition of the Torah, and the Guemarah consists of comments - or annotations - on those laws.

Here's what a typical page of the Guemarah looks like:

* The text in blue is the Mishnah, written in 'Mishnaic Hebrew' circa 189 CE. 
* The text in yellow is the Guemarah, i.e. annotations on the Mishnah. It was written in Aramaic in the 4th-5th centuries CE. 
* The text in purple is called “Rashi” was written several centuries. It explains, clarifies ambiguities from the Guemarah. Though written in Hebrew, it often uses Latin and Medieval French words to designate objects that didn't have a proper Hebrew translation. 
* The text in red is Tosafos, written in turn, in the middle ages several centuries later, in a different flavor of Hebrew.


I wonder if modern examples of annotation will ever reach the same level of complexity, depth and sophistication that is present in the Talmud.
