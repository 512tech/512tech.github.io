I'm impressed. Today Apple unveiled [HomeKit](https://developer.apple.com/homekit/) at their notorious WWDC. Yet this isn't just a bold move to enter another market, they're attempting to eliminate competition, like Nest and other connected devices. The beauty is just like Google with their [smart-watch SDK](http://developer.android.com/wear/index.html?utm_source=ausdroid.net), they're not actually entering the "connected objects" realm, rather just fabricating a user-friendly interface for developers.
