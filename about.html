  <h1 class="page-title">About</h1>

  <p>Mark Otto is a designer living and working in San Francisco. Originally from Wisconsin, he freelanced his way through high school and college before moving to California to work at a design firm, <a href="http://zurb.com">ZURB</a>, in 2007. There he designed and developed dozens of projects with clients large and small, including Photobucket, Britney Spears, SafetyWeb, and Zazzle. In early 2010, after a two-and-a-half year stint at ZURB, he left to become a product designer at Twitter.</p>
  <p>Since joining Twitter, Otto has worked on numerous projects including the Promoted Products suite, <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter.com</a>, the <a href="http://support.twitter.com">Twitter Help Center</a>, several internal tools, and most recently the popular open-source front-end toolkit <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a>.</p>
